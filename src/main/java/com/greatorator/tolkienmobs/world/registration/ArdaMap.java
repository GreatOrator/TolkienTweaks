/**
 * Arda, as the Middle-earth maps draw it.
 *
 * <p>This is a hand-drawn picture of the world rather than a climate grid. The picture is painted
 * once, at class load, into a grid of countries - one country per 512-block cell - from a list of
 * rectangles and lines that name the same places the maps do: Forodwaith across the top, Ered Luin
 * down the western seaboard, the Misty Mountains through the middle, Mirkwood and the Long Lake,
 * the Mark and Ered Nimrais, Mordor in its ring of ash, and Harad at the southern edge. Every
 * country carries the biome that belongs there, the height its ground stands at and how rough that
 * ground is, so one lookup answers both what a column is and how high it stands.
 *
 * <p>Where a country ends is not a cell boundary. Two things soften them: the heights are
 * interpolated between neighbouring cells with a smoothstep, which is what turns a drawn coast into
 * a shore and a drawn wall into a slope, and the lookups are warped by the world's own noise, so a
 * straight line drawn on paper comes out as an organic border in world. Both the biome source and
 * the generator read this class, and both are handed the same noise, so a sea is water and the
 * ground beside it is the country the map draws there.
 *
 * <p>Three things are worked out rather than drawn: the sea's biome is banded by latitude (frozen
 * ocean in the north, temperate in the middle, warm in the south), a land column at or within a few
 * blocks of sea level is a beach, and the named rivers - the Anduin, Brandywine, Greyflood, Isen,
 * Celduin, Forest River and Entwash - are cut where {@link River} draws them.
